# GameDayJunction

**Update**
This will need to be refactored completely...



Sports Website to display scores of the 4 major leagues (NHL, NBA, MLB and NFL)

This website has to have users register to the website before viewing scores. This builds individual profiles where the user will be able to select "favorite teams" which will be seen in the "scores" section upon logging in.

Once logged in and the user selects the "Scores", the user will be able to select a league out of the big 4 (NBA, NHL, MLB and NFL) and a date (via a calendar pop up).
Once submitted, the games from that day and league will show up (with favorited teams will be highlighted in a gold).

Technology Stack Used:
1. HTML
2. CSS
3. JavaScript (Vue.js as a framework)
4. PHP (server side interaction/ possible API interaction?)
5. MySQL (Database)

Used and tested through XAMPP Software, and you will need to format your XAMPP server to be able to send  emails (Used in the Contact Us form, Registration form, etc.)
